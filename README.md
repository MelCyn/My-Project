# Road Accident Dashboard

One of my interesting projects (others on the pipeline) was on the Road Accident data. I created a beautiful and interesting dashboard using Microsoft Excel which gave a comprehensive analysis of road accidents in the United Kingdom. The dashboard focuses on casualty distribution across different conditions, road types, regions, and speed limit categories and displays accident trends alongside time-based patterns.

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) give an overall view of what the data entails

-	Total Casualties
-	Total Vehicles recorded
-	Counts of Accident
-	Total number of Distinct Districts recorded

This project offers insights on
-	The Severities of accidents across regions : this shows detailed information on how severe these accidents were within the regions.
-	Casualties based on speed limits (mph) : the speed limits which were grouped into 3 categories; Cat_A (10-20), Cat_B (30-50), and Cat_C (60-70), show the sum of casualties that occurred based on their category.
-	Casualty Trends: track casualty patterns over time to ensure effective strategies to further reduce these casualties.
-	Casualties across different Conditions and Road types: show the level of accidents recorded under different conditions and road types. This helps to ensure proper caution is taken.

All this information help in making better decisions and developing strategies on how to reduce and possibly prevent further accidents/casualties recurrences.
Ceasing the opportunity to give a BIG SHOUT OUT to my team-mates @Lauretta and @Otobong, very supportive DUO.
